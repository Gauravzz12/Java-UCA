Streams Support many different kind of data ,including simple bytes,primitive data types,localised characters and objects.
Some streams only pass on data others manipulate and transform data in useful ways. 

A stream is a sequence of data.
A program uses input stream to read data from a source, one item at a time.
A program uses an output stream to write data to a destination, one item at a time.

Types of I/O Streams : 
1)Unbuffered I/O Streams (Data Stream,Object Stream)(Less Efficient)
2)Buffered I/O Streams (Byte Stream,Character Stream)(Best to use)

OR

1)Byte Streams - Used to read and write a single byte (8 bits) of data.All Byte stream classes are derived from abstract classes called Input Stream and Output Stream
2)Character Streams - Used to read and write a single character of data.All Character stream classes are derived from abstract classes called Reader and Writer.
3)Data Streams-
4)Object Streams
